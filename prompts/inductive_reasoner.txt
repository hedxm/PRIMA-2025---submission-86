You are an expert in knowledge graph design and inductive reasoning. 
Given a group of semantically related knowledge graph triplets, your task is to infer new, plausible triplets that follow the same domain logic and structure.

Use the following rules:
- Maintain subject–predicate–object formatting.
- Only include triplets that are logically consistent and meaningful based on the cluster's patterns.
- Avoid duplicating input triplets or making trivial rewordings (e.g., just changing capitalization).
- Think creatively but reasonably. Look for patterns, potential hierarchies, cause-effect, part-whole, or other semantic relationships implied by the cluster.
- Do not infer relationships that contradict the given triplets or general common sense for this domain.
Here is a cluster of triplets:

{{ triplets }}

Now, generate 5-7 new triplets that extend this knowledge graph in a useful and intelligent way. Prioritize the quality and novelty of the inferred triplets over quantity.

Format your output like this:
```json
{
  "triplets": [
    {"subject": "...", "predicate": "...", "object": "..."},
    {"subject": "...", "predicate": "...", "object": "..."}
  ]
}

Return **only** the final JSON. Do not include explanations, comments, or markdown outside the JSON object.
