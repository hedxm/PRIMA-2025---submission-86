You are an advanced knowledge extraction agent. Your task is to extract **meaningful subject–predicate–object relationships** from the following technical document.

These relationships should be represented as **triplets** where:
- **subject** = the "head" or starting entity
- **predicate** = the "relation" that connects them
- **object** = the "tail" or target entity

Text:
{{text}}

Your output must be in **JSON** format with this structure:
```json
{
  "triplets": [
    {
      "subject": "LaneKeepingAssist",
      "predicate": "uses",
      "object": "SteeringActuator"
    }
  ]
}

+ Use entity names that are reusable and consistent across triplets.

Rules:


- Use concise, lowercase, verb-based predicates, using underscores for multi-word verbs (e.g., is_defined_as, requires_input, has_part). Avoid long phrases as predicates.
- When extracting the primary definition of a TERM, try to use the predicate 'is_defined_as'. Extract other facts within the definition as separate triplets.
- Do not include explanations, markdown, or intro text.
- Extract all relevant triplets found in the provided text.
- Only return the final JSON. No comments or additional explanations.
